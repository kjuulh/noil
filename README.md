# noil

**noil** is a structured, text-buffer-based file operation tool ‚Äì think of it like [`oil.nvim`](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim), but for any editor, terminal, or automated process.

Edit filesystem operations like it's plain text, and then apply them in a controlled, explicit way.

## ‚ú® Features

* Edit your file tree like a normal buffer
* Preview, format, and apply changes
* Integrates with `$EDITOR`
* CLI first, editor agnostic
* No surprises: nothing is applied until you say so

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Basic CLI

```bash
# Preview file tree and tags
noil .

# Edit in your $EDITOR
noil edit .

# Format an existing buffer (e.g. from within your editor)
cat something.noil | noil fmt > something.noil

# Apply changes from a buffer
cat something.noil | noil apply
```

noil will always ask you if you want to apply your changes before doing any operations.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Syntax

Each line follows this format:

```
<operation> <tag?> : <filepath>
```

### Supported operations:

| Operation | Meaning                           | Tag Required? |
| --------: | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
|     `ADD` | Add new file                      | ‚ùå No          |
|    `COPY` | Copy file with given tag          | ‚úÖ Yes         |
|  `DELETE` | Delete file with given tag        | ‚úÖ Yes         |
|    `MOVE` | Move file with given tag          | ‚úÖ Yes         |
| *(blank)* | Reference existing file (default) | ‚úÖ Yes         |

---

### Example

```
         abc   :   /etc/nginx
COPY     abc   :   /tmp/nginx-copy
DELETE   123   :   /etc/nginx
ADD            :   /new/file.txt
```

You can use short, unique tags (like `abc`, `ng1`, etc.) to refer to files. `noil` will generate these tags when you run `noil .`.

## üßΩ Formatting

Want to clean up alignment and spacing?

```bash
cat my-buffer.noil | noil fmt
```

Or automatically format inside your editor with the following config for [Helix](https://helix-editor.com):

```toml
[[language]]
name = "noil"
scope = "source.noil"
injection-regex = "noil"
file-types = ["noil"]
auto-format = true
indent = { tab-width = 3, unit = "  " }
formatter = { command = "noil", args = ["fmt"] }

[[grammar]]
name = "noil"
source = { git = "https://git.front.kjuulh.io/kjuulh/tree-sitter-noil.git", rev = "2f295629439881d0b9e89108a1296881d0daf7b9" }
```

---

## üîí Safety First

No changes are ever made unless you explicitly apply them with:

```bash
# Closing the file, will trigger an apply, asking for prompt like normal
noil edit .

noil apply < my-buffer.noil
```

You will be prompted before anything is modified.

---

## üß† Philosophy

noil gives you full control over file operations in a composable and editor-friendly way. Think Git index, but for actual file moves and deletions ‚Äî human-editable, patchable, and grep-able.

---

## üì¶ Installation

**Build from source**:

```bash
cargo install --git https://git.front.kjuulh.io/kjuulh/noil.git
```

Or clone locally and run with `cargo run`.
